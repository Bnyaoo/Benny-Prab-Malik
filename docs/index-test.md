<br />
**Checkpoint**: A checkpoint is an intermediate verification step (Assertion) used to confirm that the test is proceeding correctly.
<br />
<br />
**Expected result**: The expected result of a test is the correct output based on the inputs given in the test.
<br />
<br />
**Failure**: A test failure happens when a test doesn’t complete, or when it doesn’t produce the expected result.
<br />
<br />
**Function**: A function is simply a “chunk” of code that you can use over and over again, rather than writing it out multiple times.
<br />
<br />
**Function Header**: The very first line of a function that declares the name and parameters of the function.

**Test case**: A test case is the complete set of pre-requisites, required data, and expected outcomes for a given instance of a Test. A test case may be designed to pass or to fail.
<br />
<br />
**Unit testing**: A form of White-box testing. That is, the developer knows exactly what the function should do. Good unit tests will check both valid and invalid outputs.

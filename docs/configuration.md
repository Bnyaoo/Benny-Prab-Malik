# Writing a Basic Function
{: .no_toc }

Python is capable of programming many tasks, but before we can create our own projects we need to learn the basics. This section of the guide will walk you through how to create a basic palindrome function and run the file in the command line. We want to help you develop good programming habits, so we will guide you through how to write comments, docstrings and doctests to ensure your code is able to detect a palindrome word.

## Things You Should Pay Attention To:

* Ensure that each block statement is indented (ex. Everything inside function is indented once, everything inside an if statement is indented 1 level further)
* Each opening paranthesis has a closing paranthesis
* Each conditional statement is followed with a semicolon
* Everything is typed correctly, without typos

## Command Table

Below is a list of some commands that will be needed to follow along with this document.

**Note**: We will be using the terminal built into the PyCharm IDE.

| Command         | Description                                                                                             |
| :--------       | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `#`             | Any text after an octothorpe (pound symbol) will be a comment, therefore it will not be executed        |
| `clear`         | "Clear" your terminal screen.                                                                           |
| **[Enter]**     | Processes the command that has been typed                                                               |

## Writing a Palindrome Function

One of the most common introduction problems that developers solve is determining if a string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward.

---

**1.** Open the Pycharm application by clicking the icon from the launchpad.

<br />
<br />

**2.** Click “New Project” in the top right corner of the screen.

<br />
<br />

**3.** Delete the highlighted section with “palinedromeProject” and confirm that the “create a main.py welcome script” is checked off.

<br />
<br />

**4.** Click “create” on the bottom right corner.

<br />
<br />

**5.** Highlight and delete the existing code to start coding from scratch.

<br />
>After you delete all the existing code you should have a blank file like the image below.
<br />

<br />
<br />

**6.** Type the following code.

>> **Note**: Ensure that each block statement is indented (ex. Everything inside function is indented once, everything inside an if statement is indented 1 level further)
<br />
<br />

>```
>import sys  # allows us to use command line arguments


def palindrome(word):
    # checks to see if the provided string is an empty string
    if len(word) == 0:
        print("Please enter a non-empty string")
        exit(0)

    # Checks if the provided string is just one letter
    if len(word) == 1:
        return True

    # checks the first and last index of the word (converts both letters to lowercase to avoid error)
    if word[0].lower() == word[-1].lower():
        # Recursively calls the function to make sure the first half of the string mirrors the second half of the string
        return palindrome(word[1: -1])
    # if the word is not a palindrome return false
    else:
        return False


def main():
    # takes the command line argument and stores it in the variable word
    word = sys.argv[1]
    # calls the function we created and stores the return time in a variable called isPalindrome
    isPalindrome = palindrome(word)
    # prints out the return value
    print(isPalindrome)


# Allows us to run the file only if it has been executed not imported
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

You now know how to open the terminal and input commands which allow you to navigate through your system. 

Now you are able to see files in your directories as well as your current directory, allowing you to easily navigate through your system.

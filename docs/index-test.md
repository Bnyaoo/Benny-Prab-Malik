**Expected result**: The expected result of a test is the correct output based on the inputs given in the test.
<br />
<br />
**Failure**: A test failure happens when a test doesn’t complete, or when it doesn’t produce the expected result.
<br />
<br />
**Function**: A function is simply a “chunk” of code that you can use over and over again, rather than writing it out multiple times.

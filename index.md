## Brief History
Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of _exception handling_ and _interfacing with the Amoeba operating system_.

Its implementation began in December 1989.

## Conclusion
Python is a beginner friendly language, as its syntax is more succinct and intuitive than other popular languages such as Java, C, or C++. However, even though it is beginner friendly, it is powerful enough for website and software development, task automation, data analysis, and data visualization. Due to the simple syntax and the capabilities of the language, in the past few years it has come to be one of the world’s most widely used programming languages. By following along with this document, we will introduce you to the basic operations that are recognized as industry standards. We suggest that you start with learning to code a basic function.
